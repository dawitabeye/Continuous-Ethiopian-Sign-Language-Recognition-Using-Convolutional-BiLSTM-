# Proxmox VE: Create a Snapshot for a VM

# Step-by-step instructions:

1. Log in to Proxmox Web Interface.

2. In the left panel, expand the node and click on the desired VM (e.g., VM ID 101).

3. Go to the "Snapshots" tab.

4. Click the "Take Snapshot" button at the top.

5. In the popup window:
   - Name: snapshot_name  (e.g., before_upgrade)
   - Description: (optional) Add any useful notes.
   - Include RAM: [ ] (check this if you want to save VM memory state)
   - Note: If the VM is running and "Include RAM" is not selected, the snapshot will be taken in a 'paused' state.

6. Click "Take Snapshot" to begin.

# Notes:
- Snapshots are useful for rollback before upgrades or changes.
- Snapshots consume storage â€” especially when changes occur.
- LVM-thin or ZFS storage is recommended for snapshot support.
