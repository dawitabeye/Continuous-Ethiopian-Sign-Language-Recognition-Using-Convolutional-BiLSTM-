PVE vs PBS (Proxmox VE vs Proxmox Backup Server)
=================================================

1. PVE – Proxmox Virtual Environment
------------------------------------
- Full Name: Proxmox VE (Virtual Environment)
- Type: Server Virtualization Platform
- Purpose: To run and manage virtual machines (VMs) and Linux containers (LXC)
- Key Features:
  - KVM-based virtual machines
  - LXC containers
  - Web-based GUI for full control
  - Storage management (ZFS, LVM, Ceph, etc.)
  - High Availability (HA) clustering
  - Integrated firewall and networking
  - Built-in support for backups (vzdump)
- Use Case: Hosting and managing production workloads

2. PBS – Proxmox Backup Server
------------------------------
- Full Name: Proxmox Backup Server
- Type: Backup and Restore Solution
- Purpose: To back up and restore VMs, containers, and physical hosts (via clients)
- Key Features:
  - Incremental, deduplicated, and compressed backups
  - High-speed backup/restore operations
  - Supports encryption for secure backups
  - Web GUI and command-line support
  - Works seamlessly with PVE for automated backups
  - Supports remote and offsite backup storage
- Use Case: Backup and disaster recovery for PVE and other systems

Comparison Summary
------------------
| Feature           | PVE (Proxmox VE)              | PBS (Proxmox Backup Server)         |
|-------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Main Function     | Run VMs and containers         | Backup and restore data             |
| Type              | Hypervisor / Virtualization    | Backup Solution                     |
| GUI               | Yes                            | Yes                                 |
| Backup Support    | Basic (vzdump)                 | Advanced (incremental, encrypted)   |
| Storage Options   | ZFS, LVM, Ceph, etc.           | Local, remote, encrypted            |
| Integration       | Works with PBS                 | Designed to back up PVE             |

Key Difference:
---------------
- **PVE** is for running workloads (VMs/containers).
- **PBS** is for protecting those workloads through backups.

They are **designed to work together** for a full virtualization and backup infrastructure.
