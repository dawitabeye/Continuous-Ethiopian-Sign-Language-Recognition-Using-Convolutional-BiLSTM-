# On-Premises / Colocation (Colo) Architecture

## Definition:

On-Premises (On-Prem) and Colocation (Colo) refer to traditional IT infrastructure models where physical hardware is hosted either within an organization’s own data center (on-prem) or in a third-party facility (colo).

## Pros:

* **Full Control**: Direct control over hardware, software, and security.
* **Custom Security**: Customizable security policies for regulatory needs.
* **Performance**: Low-latency access to systems and data.
* **Predictable Costs**: Fixed hardware costs without long-term subscriptions.

## Cons:

* **High Upfront Cost**: Significant capital expenditure for hardware and facilities.
* **Scalability Limitations**: Scaling up requires physical upgrades.
* **Maintenance Burden**: IT team responsible for patches, upgrades, and failures.
* **Disaster Recovery**: Requires extensive planning and investment.

# What is Cloud Computing?

Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and more—over the internet (“the cloud”) to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale.

---

# Why Cloud?

* **Scalability**: Instantly scale resources based on demand.
* **Cost Efficiency**: Pay-as-you-go pricing reduces capital expenditure.
* **Global Access**: Access services from anywhere in the world.
* **Resilience**: Built-in redundancy and disaster recovery.
* **Managed Services**: Offload infrastructure management to the provider.
* **Innovation**: Rapid access to new technologies (AI, ML, analytics).

* **GCP**: Cloud Functions
* **AWS**: Lambda
* **Azure**: Azure Functions

## Benefits:

* No server management
* Auto-scaling
* Cost based on actual usage (per invocation)
* Faster time to market

---

# Container Orchestration

* **TeleCloud**: Object Storage

## Benefits:

* Scalable and durable
* Cost-effective tiered storage
* Integration with analytics and AI tools
* Secure and compliant

---

# AI and Machine Learning Platforms

Services to build, train, and deploy machine learning models at scale.

* **GCP**: Vertex AI (formerly AI Platform)
* **AWS**: SageMaker
* **Azure**: Azure Machine Learning

## Benefits:

* Pre-built and custom ML models
* AutoML and MLOps support
* Scalable infrastructure for training and inference
* Integration with data pipelines
