Got it! Here's a **detailed explanation of Proxmox network configuration using bond + bridge via the GUI (Web Interface)** — ideal for note-taking or `.txt` documentation:

---

### 🖥️ Proxmox GUI: Network Configuration (Bond + Bridge)

#### 🔹 Step 1: Open Network Settings

* Login to **Proxmox Web GUI**.
* In the **left panel**, select your **Proxmox node** (e.g., `pve`).
* Go to **Datacenter > Node > System > Network**.

---

#### 🔹 Step 2: Create a Bond

1. Click **"Create" > "Linux Bond"**.
2. Fill in:

   * **Name**: `bond0` (or other name).
   * **Slaves**: Select at least 2 physical NICs (e.g., `eno1`, `eno2`).
   * **Bond Mode**: Choose depending on your need:

     * `Active Backup (mode 1)` → simple failover, no switch config required.
     * `LACP (802.3ad, mode 4)` → load balancing + redundancy; needs switch support.
   * Leave **Xmit Hash Policy**, **Miimon**, and others at default unless advanced setup.
3. Click **"OK"** to create the bond.

#### 🔹 Step 3: Create a Bridge

1. Click **"Create" > "Linux Bridge"**.
2. Fill in:

   * **Name**: `vmbr0` (default bridge name in Proxmox).
   * **Bridge Ports**: Select your bond interface (e.g., `bond0`).
   * **IPv4/CIDR**: Example: `192.168.1.100/24`.
   * **Gateway (IPv4)**: e.g., `192.168.1.1`.
   * **IPv6**: Leave disabled unless used.
3. Click **"OK"** to save the bridge.

---

#### 🔹 Step 4: Apply and Confirm

* You’ll see both `bond0` and `vmbr0` listed.
* Click **"Apply Configuration"** or **"Reboot"** if prompted.
* A warning will appear if you’re connected via web — confirm and wait for reconnection.
* Use **local console (shell/monitor)** if you're unsure, to prevent being locked out.

---

#### ✅ Result

* Now, `bond0` handles traffic through two NICs.
* `vmbr0` acts as a virtual switch connecting VMs to the bonded NICs.
* VMs should use `vmbr0` as their **bridge interface**.

---

#### 🧠 Notes

* **Bonding mode 1** (Active Backup) is safest for simple setups.
* **LACP (mode 4)** requires switch ports to be in **LAG**/LACP group.
* Avoid misconfiguring NICs currently used by the web interface — it may cause disconnect.
